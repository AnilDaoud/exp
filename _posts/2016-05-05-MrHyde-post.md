The first posts were all SSH/vim powered but that's rather inconvenient on a mobile device. But by simply using [github](https://github.com/AnilDaoud/exp) to version control the whole thing I can use [MrHyde](http://faudroids.org/MrHyde/94) to send posts from my phone.

And that's it! This is my first 'on the go' post.

I've made a bunch of additional changes, removed the Google Plus comments, added a tag cloud, now this website's design is truly horrible.
