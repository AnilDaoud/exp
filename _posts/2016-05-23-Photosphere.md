Using Android phones (and probably iPhones) you can now take cool [PhotoSpheres](http://www.androidcentral.com/photo-sphere).
These are easy enough to upload to Google Maps with Street View, or to embed on your website, however if you feel like sharing them on YouTube or Facebook, Google has not (yet) made this straightforward.

[ClimbCodeCreate](http://climbcodecreate.com/2016/01/27/share-360-panosphere-images-on-facebook-and-youtube/) has a nice tutorial, but as mentioned there _Skill Level: Intermediate_.

Using a bit of JS and a bit of PHP, i have scripted the process [here](http://anil.diwi.org/photosphere/).
If add a bit of css, and a progress bar at the time of conversion to video, this could even become a proper app?
Well, until Google simply adds a button in the Photos webapp to do this that is.
